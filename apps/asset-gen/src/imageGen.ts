### Chinese Phrase Image Generation Prompt
You will receive a **Chinese phrase**. Create a single image that conveys the **complete meaning** of the phrase through **visual storytelling**.  
The image will be used as a flashcard where the viewer guesses or writes the phrase based on the scene.
---
Style & Visual Guidelines
- Do **not** include any text, Chinese characters, or emojis.  
- Style: **minimal**, **anime/cartoon**.  
- Background: **white** or **light grey**.  
- Use **fairly saturated colors**, avoid sepia tones.  
- Keep the composition **simple and clear**.
---
Semantic Requirements
- Depict a **scene** where the phrase would naturally occur — not just isolated objects.  
- Every **word** in the phrase must be visually represented.  
- Clearly show **relationships** (e.g., who is whose sister, what action happened, where it took place).  
- Express **time or tense** if relevant — use visual cues like:
  - faded backgrounds or sepia tones for “past”
  - younger/older versions of a character for age differences
  - contextual objects or clothing to indicate time period  
- The image should make sense **only when all words** are understood together (not from one word alone).
---
Process
Before creating the image:
1. **Describe** in one sentence the full scene that represents the meaning of the phrase — including *who*, *when*, *where*, and *what’s happening*.  
2. Then, **draw that scene**.
---
Example
**Phrase:** 我 妹妹 小 时候 住 在 北京。  
**Interpretation:** “My little sister lived in Beijing when she was young.”  
**Good depiction:** An adult reminiscing while looking at a childhood photo of his little sister playing near a Beijing hutong, showing both past and relationship context.
---
**Phrase:** ${phrase}
